# Lines that begin with a hash will be ignored. 
# 
# Please follow these instructions closely. 
# You need to supply two lines only in this file. 
# On the first line, you must give us your student number. 
#
# On the second, please include the *precise* URL for the server on your QUT Linux VM
# Provide a http address if you are only serving http, and https if you have that working.
# Do *not* give us an entry for both HTTP and HTTPS -- just one please 
# Specify the port if it isn't the default: 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS
# You can get this by opening up a terminal on the VM - the computer name is the name to use there
# For example, if your computer name is VDI-VL24-999 and you have https working
# and you are using port 443 (the default): https://VDI-VL24-999.qut.edu.au
#
# ****DO NOT USE ANY version of http://localhost or https://localhost****
# You must use an explicit address.
#
# Please edit the dummy entries below and save the file.  
# Final check -- **don't** leave the student number as n1234567 
#             -- make sure your URL is the correct one and not full of xxxs and yyys
#
n10642536
https://VDI-VL24-330.qut.edu.au:443
